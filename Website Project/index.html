                <h1 class="college-title">Collegiate Accomplishments</h1>
                <p>Throughout my undergraduate years at Centre College I have been fortunate to intern at various companies and perform on-campus research - all within my study of interest: data analysis.</p>
            </div>

                    <h2>Internships</h2>
                    <p>With help from Centre College's strong alumni network, I secured four internships during my undergraduate years. My rising-junior summer I interned for Schneider Electric in Louisville, KY as an invoice analyst and validation intern. My junior spring I spent in Washington, D.C. and interned at CAPTEL where I developed self-written Python scripts to provide in-depth analyses on optimal processes for political fundraising. And in my rising-senior summer I intered for two legal firms in Nashville, TN, one for-profit and one non-profit. At Bass, Berry & Sims, I was a data analysis intern focused on developing actionable insights from in-house pro bono data and finding trends in Nashville's pre-trial system. At the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, I was a volunteer law clerk and assisted with client intake into the Volunteer Lawyers Program.</p>

                    <h2>Club Involvement</h2>
                    <p>While at Centre College, I was well-rounded in my non-academic involvements. While well-rounded, my primary focuses were on enhancing the Greek Life experience and broadening Centre students' ability to volunteer in new capacites. Within Greek Life, I held the public relations chair for both my fraternity and the larger interfraternal council (IFC). My senior year I shifted leadership roles and ran as the president for IFC while I continued as public relations chair for my fraternity. Aside from Greek Life, I helped co-found the Centre College Dance Marathon which helps to fundraise and spread awareness for pediatric cancer. And as a long-time member of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), I helped to recruit individuals to aid in the annual JDRF walk in Louisville, KY.</p>

                    <h2>Study-Away</h2>
                    <p>Twice at Centre College, I participated in study-away opportunities. My junior spring I studied in Washington, D.C. where my studies were concentrated on the operations of the Legislative branch and of the arts and architecture in the D.C. metro area. My senior winter term I studied in Lake Tahoe, CA where... </p>

                    <h2>Awards</h2>
                    <p>During my studies, I received Dean's List honors twice - my freshman spring and my junior spring. During the 2020 - 2021 school year, I helped compose a three-page document demonstrating how my fraternity chapter excelled in all aspects of operations. My chapter won the National Chapter Achievement Award, an award given to twenty-seven chapters of over two hundred.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>Under the guidance of Dr. Jeffrey Heath, a team of eight Centre College students developed the Centre Sports Analytics program. Working with Muhammad Mujtaba, we predicted the best lineups and subsets of Centre College's men's collegiate basketball. In my junior fall, I focused on the time of possession by Centre's basketball team.During my senior year I focused on enhancing the current win probability system previous research assistants have begun to develop as well as creating a webpage for the entire researvh team's findings. </p>                    </div>

                <h2><u>Undergrad Mathematics Student</u></h2>
                <p>Originally from Louisville, KY and currently residing in southern Indiana, I am a senior mathematics major at Centre College in Danville, KY. As a kid, I have always had a knack for numbers and mathematics quickly grew to be not only my favorite subject, but a passion of mine. It was not until the on-campus research, the analytical internships, and the numerous side projects, that I realized the true potential of understanding the world's numbers. As I finish my undergraduate study, I am looking to grow my fascination, harden my skills as an analytical thinker, and look for new ways that data can improve our understanding of the world.</p>
